# Modified Prototype 5 (beta) parts
These have been modified to not require supports within the parts and to use screws for assembly instead of press/friction-fit.
(I also reccommend printing with PETG, and not PLA)

VERY WIP, ALMOST CERTAINLY WON'T WORK

FingerRack is also 0.2mm thicker to account for the higher flexibility of PETG
